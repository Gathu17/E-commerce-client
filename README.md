# E-Commerce Client
This is the client-side of my E-commerce web app built in React. The app uses Apollo-client to fetch data from the GraphQl server. 
The app website was styled using styled-components and semantic-ui framework. The app also utilized redux toolkit to handle the state of items in the cart.

The following functionalities were implemented in the app:
 - Users can login and register on the site
 - Users can view and filter through products in the site.
 - Users can add and remoe items from the cart.
 - Users can checkout and make payments via stripe.
 
 The client-side was hosted on netlify.
